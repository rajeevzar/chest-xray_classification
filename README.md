# chest-xray_classification
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to for binary classification of chest X-rays (pneumonia or normal), using the widely-used Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle. The model is built on MobileNet, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision apps. I obtained 93% accuracy.
